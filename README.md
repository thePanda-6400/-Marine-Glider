## Appendices

### Follow Up on Project Plan

The project plan provided a clear direction, allowing important decisions on functionalities and material choices. Agile adjustments were necessary as the project progressed, including changes to the hull material and sensor choices due to supply limitations and time constraints. Despite these challenges, the project successfully created a minimum viable product with modular design for future enhancements.

### Technical Analyses

#### Buoyancy Engine

A syringe-based buoyancy engine was selected for its effectiveness in state-of-the-art underwater gliders. Key constraints included size, strength, and availability. The design met these constraints, ensuring the glider's functionality at the target depth of 70 meters.

#### Battery Module

NiMH batteries were chosen over Li-ion due to supplier limitations and safety regulations. Although Li-ion offers superior qualities, NiMH batteries provided a feasible alternative within the project's constraints.

### Testing Protocol and Results

Three real-world tests were conducted to ensure a fully operational product: two at the Ocean Towing Tank at University College London and one at Mercers Lake in Redhill, UK. Precautions were taken to prevent drone loss or damage, ensuring successful testing outcomes.
